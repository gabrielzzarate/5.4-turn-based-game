## 5.4 turn based game

You will be building a turn based battle game. If you're familiar with older
video games, think of Pokemon or Final Fantasy. The UI can be very very basic,
just some headings for names and info, a dropdown, and a couple of buttons.



The gameplay should go back and forth between an enemy and the player, each inflicting damage on the other when they launch a successful attack.
There should be multiple player types.
There should be multiple enemy types.
You should be able to select the player type from a dropdown.
The enemy type should be randomly generated.
The player should manually select the "Fight" action to attack.

You should use constructors and prototypes for the players and enemies.
The player's health should be visible.
The enemies health may be visible, at your discretion.
